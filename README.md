# numc

Numc was both a programming project as well as an optimization project, where I implemented a naive version of Num.py in C and then attempted to optimize some of the matrix operations to be as fast as the original Num.py. To increase performance, I optimized the algorithm, used SIMD instructions, and implemented parallel programming with OpenMP. Ultimately, my optimized matrix operations were approximately 500x faster than the naive implementation.
